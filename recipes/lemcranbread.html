        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Bread</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 extra large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest (about 3 medium lemons)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for coating cranberries</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup sweetened dried cranberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Icing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ounce full fat cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter an 8-1/2x4-1/2-inch loaf pan, and line the bottom with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>For bread, whisk together sugar, buttermilk, oil, eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and vanilla in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Add in 2 cups flour, baking powder, and baking soda and mix until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Toss cranberries with about 1 1/2 teaspoons flour in a small bowl until coated. Fold cranberries into batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out with just a few moist crumbs, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool bread in the pan for 20 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>For icing, beat cream cheese, confectionerâ€™s sugar, lemon juice, milk, and pinch of salt together in a bowl with an electric mixer until fully smooth and combined. Add more milk if needed for thinner icing, 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Spread glaze evenly over the top of cooled loaf.</li>
        </ol>
